I used tikz package in $\LaTeX$ to draw some diagrams for LBM algorithms.

Here are my works.

## D3Q27 models

They can be regenerated by compiling the corresponding `.tex` files in `./d2q9/` and `./d3q27/` directories, and then converting the output `.pdf` files to `.svg` files by suitable tools(I recommand `pymupdf`, as shown in my repo [here](https://github.com/Xuanyiyiren/Intersting-things/blob/main/pdf2svg/pdf2svg.py)).

Main works are contributed by my prompt with GPT-5 in Copilot.
